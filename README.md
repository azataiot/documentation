# documentation
Some websites or tools only provides online documentations, which is good but not very friendly when viewing offline. I like reading a bunch ( whole ) documentation while i am flying and for that reason i need their PDF versions on my iPad or Amazon Kindle. Here I created this repo, to save them as PDF so i can review and read easily.
